Ants have superhuman strength!
Yes, you did read that correctly. Ants are ridiculously strong. They have the ability to carry between 10 and 50 times their own body weight! The amount an ant can carry depends on the species. The Asian weaver ant, for example, can lift 100 times its own mass.

Why are ants strong?

This amazing strength is a result of their small size, believe it or not. The Arizona State University reports that because of their small size, antsâ€™ muscles have a greater cross-sectional area relative to their body size compared to larger animals. This means they can produce more force.
